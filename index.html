                The cocktail survived for a few decades in America’s bars and pubs, but the following it had attained was not enough to see it through \
                to the latter half of the century, and it soon faded into obscurity. This drink has seen a recent revival in American cocktail bars. <br><br>\
                Green Charteuse is an ingredient worthy of note – it’s a French liqueur made by Carthusian Monks and is (allegedly) flavoured with 130 different herbs, \
                giving it a strong medicinal edge. Its careful craft would have been in great contrast to the bathtub gin of the Prohibition era.",

                 Legend has long held that the historic NOLA drink might even be America's first cocktail. <br> <br> Antoine Amédée Peychaud is the man most associated with those beginnings. \
                 He ran a drug store in New Orleans in the 1830s and created Peychaud's Bitters -- an ingredient still served in Sazeracs to this day. \
                 Peychaud was born in Haiti, but fled to Louisiana as violence erupted between the slaves and French colonists, and he eventually set up his own dispensary in New Orleans. \
                 On top of filling prescriptions, he apparently served his customers toddies mixed with his bitters and Sazerac de Forge et Fils cognac. \
                 They became so popular that a bar called the Sazerac Coffee House started buying his bitters and pouring a blend of the Sazerac cognac, bitters, sugar, and absinthe as their signature cocktail. \
                 Eventually they purchased the rights to the bitters outright, subbed the cognac for rye whiskey, and the Sazerac was born.",

                However, the basic recipe was known for over a century prior. In that time, professional sailors suffered from scurvy, malnutrition, and sea-sicknesses, \
                until a bartender’s hero named Vice Admiral Edward Vernon of England began mixing a few ingredients together to serve to his crew. \
                Sailors had a ration of various things, like limes and lemons to prevent scurvy, and liquor for something safe to drink. \
                To prevent a ship full of intoxicated shipmates, the liquor, usually rum, was watered down, and lemon or lime juice was added to mask the flavor. Hence, we have a very early version of the Sour.<br><br>\
                The sailors then brought this concept to shore and eventually the basics of the sour cocktail were refined to what we know it as today. \
                Gin and Brandy were also substituted in by the English, but the Americans were more fond of the native whiskey. Jerry Thomas ultimately refined and published this imbibement, codifying the sour into black and white.\
                Egg was later added as a creamy, frothy element to the cocktail that went down smoother…although some bartenders insist that this makes the drink a Boston Sour.",

                the daiquiri's origin is backed up by an actual cocktail recipe card signed by a 'Jennings Cox' in 1896. \
                Cox, an American engineer who lived and worked in Cuba after the Spanish-American War, \
                is believed to have invented the daiquiri after running out of gin while throwing a cocktail party, substituting rum since rum was plentiful in the country. \
                It turned out to be a huge hit, and Cox christened it the 'Daiquiri', naming the drink after a nearby port town.<br><br>\
                In 1909, Cox's cocktail, which until then could only be found in Cuba, was brought to America by Admiral Lucius W. Johnson, who introduced it to Washington, D.C.'s Army and Navy Club.<br><br>\
                The frozen daquiri was born in the 1920’s by the bartender/owner of the Floridita in Havana, Cuba by adding shaved ice.",
